## Descriptionüìù

This application was created for an internet retail company. It allows the manager to have the back end for their e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies so that the compnay can compete with other e-commerce companies

## InstallationüöÄ

In order to run this application you must run the command  <code>npm i</code> to install the necessary dependencies. Confirm that the MySQL server is tunred on and run <code>CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_db;</code> to create the database. Then return to your console and run <code>node seeds/index.js</code> to seed the database. Then run <code>npm start</code> and navigate to http://localhost:3001/ in your browser. I will be using Insomnia to test all of the routes for this application. Insomnia will also need to be installed to your machine by going to this website --> https://insomnia.rest/.
